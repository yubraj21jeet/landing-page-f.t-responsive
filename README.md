Vire Track: Interstellar Asteroid Tracker & Risk Analyser
Team Name
Overnight Learners

Problem Statement
In the vastness of space, thousands of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) and Interstellar Objects (ISOs) pass by our planet daily. While space agencies like NASA track these meticulously, the raw data remains inaccessible or difficult to interpret for the general public, local researchers, and amateur astronomers. There is a lack of user-friendly tools that translate complex orbital data into understandable visualizations and risk assessments.

Challenge
Build a full-stack web platform that processes and visualizes interstellar object data, providing comprehensive monitoring with real-time risk analysis, interactive 3D orbital visualizations, and collaborative features for the astronomy community.

Project Overview
Vire Track is a Next.js-powered scientific dashboard for real-time Interstellar Object (ISO) monitoring and risk analysis. The platform transforms complex astronomical data into intuitive visualizations, enabling researchers and space enthusiasts to track, analyze, and discuss interstellar objects with unprecedented clarity.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is built for educational and hackathon purposes only. It uses simulated/mock data and should not be used for actual astronomical predictions or safety decisions.
